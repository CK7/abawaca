# abawaca
abawaca (A Binning Algorithm Without A Cool Acronym) is a binning program that can take advantage of different types of information such as differential coverage and DNA signature. The program is under development, and the current version (1.00) works with no known bugs, but you should go over the results and validate the bins as some of them may be crappy.
