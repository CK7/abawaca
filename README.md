# abawaca
abawaca (A Binning Algorithm Without A Cool Acronym) is a binning program that can take advantage of different types of information such as differential coverage and DNA signature. The program is currently under development and the version provided here is still not fully supported. We plan to publish an "official" version of the program within a few months with detailed help pages and full support so please check again later later this year.
